# ChessAI

Welcome to my ChessAI project!

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a chess-playing AI using Python. It is being built as part of my journey to participate in the ChessAI competition sponsored by FIDE, Google, and Kaggle.

## Day 1-2:
It's been a while since I last worked in Python, so I’ve started by revisiting the basics. I’ve set up the development environment and tested the `python-chess` library to handle chess board creation and basic moves.

### Goals:
- Develop a chess-playing AI.
- Focus on efficiency due to strict CPU and memory limitations in the competition.
